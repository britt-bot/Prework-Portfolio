# Prework-Portfolio... The Prequel?

## Description 

A portfolio is a gathering of completed and in progress works, that are used to showcase a skilled person's end results and/or work styles. 


This page was one of my first "projects", and you can follow the progression of my skills with the updated versions linked below. This project was to use your current knowledge and create your portfolio page. **DISCLAIMER** Trust the process! ðŸ¤ªðŸ˜…ðŸ¤©ðŸ¥³
