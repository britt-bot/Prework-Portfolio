# Prework-Portfolio

## Description 

This page is one of my first "projects". It is one of the prework assignments during the bootcamp course. The project was to use your current knowledge to create your portfolio page. **DISCLAIMER** Trust the process! ðŸ¤ªðŸ˜…ðŸ¤©ðŸ¥³

A portfolio is a gathering of completed and in progress works, that are used to showcase a skilled person's end results and/or work styles. This is part of the evolution of my skills through the progression shown in my portfolio.


Here are the links to the updated versions of my Portfolio:

## Usage 

This application is used to show potential clients and employers my skills, by demonstrating them in both, the front and back-end design of this page. This page is also showcasing the previous projects I have worked on, which show various other skill sets gained from both solo and team work environments.
